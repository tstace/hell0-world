# hell0-world
This is the name of a repository that was made when I first found out about github.com
In the past, I have made a few, fairly unsuccessful attempts, to learn how to program. 
The biggest dilemma that I faced was not being very sure where to start. Perhaps it 
was naive to think that there was only one proper way to learn coding. After all, many 
have learnt coding without the plethora of material available about the topic. But it was 
that plethora of material that was intimidating. Where to start? What type of code to learn first?
It was all so much that I set aside the idea of learning. I do, after all, have different things
going on in my life. But, again the itch of learning how to code needed to be scratched, and I 
started looking at websites and blogs about coding. That time around though, I found entries that did 
not seem so deadset on trying to say one code is better than another. They urged people to just start, somewhere
anywhere. And so that is what I did. I had some knowledge of python--though the idea of knowledge has many caveats. 
When I say knowledge, I meant that I knew how to do the print 'hello world' statement. So I decided on python. The
way that I figured was this. If I learn python, if I learn how to read the documentation for that program, at least it
might enable me to get through documentation related to another coding programs in the future. Randomly, I searched
python and learning one day, and I came across Zed Shaw's 'Learn Python the Hard Way.' After reading the introduction, 
I was intrigued and basically convinced. I philosophically agree with the idea of repetition of commands and just working 
in python with not fully knowing what I was doing. That is to say, I have seen it work effectively as an approach in other 
areas. That is,this same sort of approach is useful for many types of other works 
other than simply programming. This is because a beginner can get overwhelmed at the amount of information thrown at them
too quickly.  I have taught people to do things before, and if you throw too many terms at them too quickly, nothing seems
to get resolved. It is more work on the person giving these in-depth lessons anyways. What is said one day, will need to be
repeated the next day. No, in some cases it is better just to instruct someone what to do, and when they begin to get the basics, 
they may begin understanding indepth explanations later.
